# 20 React: React Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio that showcases the work I have completed as a developer.
It is a single page application that uses react components to toggle from page to page. The pages that are included are a section about myself, a list of my recently created projects, a list of recent skills learned and a page for contact. The application uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and React and is deployed on GitHub pages.
